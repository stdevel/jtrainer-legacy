		<h3 id="create">How to create your own catalogs</h3>
		To create your own catalogs, you need a simple text edtior - you will have to write a file in a format as explained below.
		In future, there will be a catalog editor included in the software - so stay tuned for updates. ;-)
		<br />
		A catalog file has the following structure:		
		<pre>
		Number of questions
		Catalog name
		Catalog description
		Author <email>
		Date
		Time limit (if you don't want a time limit, enter 0 here)
		(Data records...)
		</pre>
		
		A data record has the following structure:
		<pre>
		Question
		Type
		Answer(s)
		Number of correct answer (if multiple, counting starts at 0!)
		Question hint (if you don't want a hint to be displayed, insert "NONE" here)
		Question explanation (if you don't want to display a explanation insert "NONE" here)
		</pre>
		
		There are several question types:
		<ul>
			<li><b>0</b> - only one answer, has to be typed using the keyboard</li>
			<li><b>1</b> - multiple answers, one is correct, displayed in a list</li>
			<li><b>2</b> - multiple answers, multiple are correct, displayed in a list</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		
		An example of a complete question catalog is:
		<pre>

		144
		192
		120

		The number is smaller than 180
		Everybody knows, that the product of 12*12 is 144!
		</pre>
		<br />
		
		<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
		There are two options, which can be configured in the settings dialog:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Random mode</b> - Questions are asked randomly</li>
			<li><b>Endless mode</b> - The catalogs continues after finishing, questions are repeated until you stop the simulation</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
